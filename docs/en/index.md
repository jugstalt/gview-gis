Welcome to gView GIS
====================

gView GIS is an easy-to-use [Open Source](https://github.com/jugstalt/gview5) GI framework for visualizing and managing spatial data (geospatial data). 
In addition to displaying the data, gView GIS supports a lot of other features, such as layer control, legend design, 
spatial queries, labeling, measure distances and surfaces, and much more.

The entire framework is programmed in .NET and can be extended with all .NET languages via plug-ins. The spectrum of these extensions 
includes, for example, custom tools, renderers for displaying map objects, symbolism, 
Data sources for vector and raster data, as well as interfaces for exporting the maps through the gView Map Server. 

The components of the gView Framework can be divided into two categories:

* **Desktop GIS:** These are the *gView Carto* and *gView DataExplorer* applications designed for the Windows Desktop. 
  Using these applications, maps can be created or geodata can be managed.


* **gView Server** is a map server that publishes the created maps as map services.
  In addition to OGC standards (WMS, WFS), the services are also available in formats such as GeoServices REST and ArcXML. This makes it 
  easy to view and query the services in any popular GIS software.
